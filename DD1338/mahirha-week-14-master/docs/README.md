If written answers are required, you can add them to this file. Just copy the relevant questions from the root of the repo, preferably in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format :)


2. Calculate the asymptotic worst-case-time for all public methods in your
   implementation. Express the time as a function of the number of elements `n`
   in the list. Put your answers in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)


addFirst() : O(1)  
addLast() : O(1)  
getFirst() : O(1)  
getLast() : O(1)  
get() : O(n)  
removeFirst() : O(1)  
clear() : O(1)  
size() : O(1)  
isEmpty() : O(1)  
toString() : O(n)
